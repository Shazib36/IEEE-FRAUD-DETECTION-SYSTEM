An important aspect of the current financial world is that online transaction fraud costs billions of dollars every year. This project focuses on investigating machine learning for fraud detection on the IEEE-CIS dataset (590,540 transactions; 3.5% fraud). By combining statistical analysis with modern machine-learning techniques, we will see whether the amounts involved in transactions are correlated with fraud and build a predictive model that improves detection. First, this involved preprocessing the data (joining identity and transaction data, managing more than four hundred features with missing values and categorical encoding). The exploratory data analysis revealed interesting patterns: fraudulent transactions have a slightly higher median amount, as well as differing temporal behaviors (fraud peaks earlier in the morning) from the genuine ones. We conduct tests of our hypotheses (Mann-Whitney U, Welchâ€™s t-test), which confirm that there exists a statistically significant difference between transaction amounts in fraud and non-fraud cases (p < 0.001), though there is a large overlap between their distributions themselves. Next, we build several machines learning models, including gradient-boosted tree methods (LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost), as well as a neural network, with stratified training and evaluation of ROC AUC and precision-recall metrics. Thus, our best model (XGBoost ensemble) achieved AUC 0.95 and 95% precision on the fraud class, outperforming the baseline rules. Weights of evidence for explanations, through Shapley values (SHAP), suggest transaction amount, card and address matches, and device info are important. Practical aspects of deployment are discussed, including class imbalance treatment, real-time inference speed, and the inherent practical trade-off between false positives and negatives. Conclusive recommendations are made about the integration of ML-based fraud detection in financial systems, pursued with ethical considerations and future research avenues on adaptive and hybrid techniques.

How can machine learning algorithms be utilized to predict fraudulent financial transactions and improve fraud detection systems in the financial industry?

Fraudulent financial transactions are a major concern for financial institutions worldwide, leading to billions in losses annually. Conventional approaches to fraud detection based on manual investigation and rule systems are fast dwindling in effectiveness through high false positives and limited capacity to detect complex fraud patterns. A much more scalable and effective solution comes in the form of machine learning, which can pick patterns hidden in transaction data, enabling financial institutions to detect and avert fraud in real-time, preventing monetary losses as they occur.
